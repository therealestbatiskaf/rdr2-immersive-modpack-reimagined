[PedDamageConfiguration]

;=====================================================================================
; 1. CORE MOD SETTINGS
;=====================================================================================
; This section contains the main toggles for the mod, including the menu hotkey,
; whether the script is enabled on startup, and its effective range.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;ToggleKey is the F-key you want to use to open the mod menu
;Changed to F10 by default to not conflict with Enhanced Brawling's bindings
ToggleKey = 10

;EnableScriptByDefault can be set to 1 or 0, depending if you want to have to enable the script manually or it should be active by default.
EnableScriptByDefault = 1

;DisableModInMissions can be set to either 0 or 1, if set to 1 the mod's effects will be disabled during missions.
DisableModInMissions = 0

;ModEffectRange is a value which describes the number of NPCs which are affected by the mod, chosen randomly from all NPC's currently spawned.
;If you set this lower than the ped density of a specific area, NPC's will be randomly excluded from the script's features.
;I've noticed zero performance impact by leaving this at 256, even in Saint Denis.
ModEffectRange = 256

;DisableHitmarker disables hit marker feedback (the white and red X over the reticle) when you hit a target.
DisableHitmarker = 1
;StaticReticle prevents the reticle from turning red when you aim at a valid target.
StaticReticle = 0


;=====================================================================================
; 2. HEALTH & DAMAGE
;=====================================================================================
; This section controls the base health values for different types of NPCs in the game.
; Setting custom health values is a core feature for balancing combat difficulty.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;NPCHealth is the standard health for an NPC (randomly calculated between Min and Max value - different for each NPC) - setting it to 0 does NOT disable this feature.
;If you feel like enemies hit dying states too quickly, increase the max for NPC's and Police, but but DO NOT lower them below the Dying State threshold (50 by default) or peds will DIE on spawn!
NPCHealthMin = 75
NPCHealthMax = 75
;PoliceNPCHealth sets the health of lawmen, which are no friendly or other story NPCs to the given amount (randomly calculated between Min and Max value - different for each NPC) - setting it to 0 disables the feature
PoliceNPCHealthMin = 75
PoliceNPCHealthMax = 75

;FriendlyStoryNPCHealth sets the health of friendly story NPCs to the given amount (randomly calculated between Min and Max value - different for each NPC) - setting it to 0 disables the feature (friendly story NPCs are left at their vanilla health)
FriendlyStoryNPCHealthMin = 450
FriendlyStoryNPCHealthMax = 450
;OtherStoryNPCHealth sets the health of other story NPCs to the given amount (randomly calculated between Min and Max value - different for each NPC) - setting it to 0 disables the feature (other story NPCs are left at their vanilla health)
OtherStoryNPCHealthMin = 0
OtherStoryNPCHealthMax = 0

;NPCHealthInVehicles governs the health of NPCs in vehicles - since they cannot transition into a dying state, they become bullet sponges when NPCHealth is set too high.
NPCHealthInVehicles = 70
;NPCHealthVehicleToDyingState - if an NPC exits the vehicle and has below this percentage of NPCHealthInVehicles, its health gets set to the DyingMovementThreshold.
NPCHealthVehicleToDyingState = 75
;NPCHealthVehicleToFull - if an NPC exits the vehicle and has above this percentage of NPCHealthInVehicles, its health is set to NPCHealth.
NPCHealthVehicleToFull = 90


;=====================================================================================
; 3. PLAYER & HORSE HEALTH
;=====================================================================================
; This section contains settings for player and horse survivability,; as well as
; damage multipliers that affect how much damage NPCs deal to the player.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;Playerinvincibility is the setting for the player to be invincible (values: 0 or 1)
PlayerInvincibility = 0
;PlayerHealth sets the player's health to the given amount - only works if PlayerInvincibility is disabled (setting it to 0 disables this feature)
PlayerHealth = 0

;HorseInvincibility is the setting for the currently mounted horse to be invincible (values: 0 or 1)
HorseInvincibility = 0
;HorseHealth sets the health of the currently mounted horse to the given amount - only works if HorseInvincibility is disabled (setting it to 0 disables this feature)
HorseHealth = 0

;EnablePlayerDisarming allows NPC's to disarm the player if they shoot the weapon arm.
EnablePlayerDisarming = 1
;PlayerDisarmingChance dictates the chance the player will drop their currently held weapon if an NPC hits them in the arm.
PlayerDisarmingChance = 15

; --- 3.1. NPC Weapon Damage ---
;NPCWeaponModifier is a flat modifier for NPC weapon damage done to the player.
;100% = vanilla, 50% would mean half of vanilla, 150% would be an extra 50% damage, etc.
NPCWeaponModifier = 130
;NPCMeleeModifier is a flat modifier for NPC melee damage done to the player.
;100% = vanilla, 50% would mean half of vanilla, 150% would be an extra 50% damage, etc.
NPCMeleeModifier = 105

; --- 3.2. Player Weapon Damage ---
;The settings for SpecialWeaponModifier and WeaponModifier have been deprecated.
;You can now change individual weapon damage outputs. It's at the end of this .ini file, under "22. INDIVIDUAL WEAPON DAMAGE".


;=====================================================================================
; 4. BODY PART DAMAGE MODIFIERS
;=====================================================================================
; This section controls locational damage multipliers, affecting how much damage
; different body parts receive. It also includes logic for how NPCs react to having
; both legs injured.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;Player Bodypart Damage Modifiers regulate the amount of damage certain body parts take.
;100 = 100%. 150 would mean 50% extra damage to that zone. 50 would mean the player takes 50% less damage to that zone.
;This only applies to the player. If you enable the debug menu and set it to player stats only, you can see the raw and adjusted damage as you get hit.
PlayerLegDamageModifier = 100
PlayerArmDamageModifier = 100
PlayerTorsoDamageModifier = 100
PlayerHeadDamageModifier = 100
PlayerNeckDamageModifier = 100

;NPC Bodypart Damage Modifiers - regulates the amount of damage certain body parts take.
;100 is 100%, 50 would be 50%, meaning half the damage is done when this body part is hit.
;This only applies to NPC's.
;HeadDamageModifier is ignored if EnhancedHeadshots is enabled, given EnhancedHeadshots has its own method of handling head damage.
LegDamageModifier = 50
ArmDamageModifier = 40
TorsoDamageModifier = 120
HeadDamageModifier = 150
NeckDamageModifier = 50

;DamagedLegsDownTime is the min and max time in milliseconds after which an NPC gets forced down after both legs have been hit at least once. Was in the original code, but wasn't functioning.
;So if you shoot the left and right leg, you'll trigger the vanilla LEGS HURT - STUMBLING logic, but on top of that, a timer starts, and an NPC has this long before they'll hit the first dying state.
;Stops them from running and stumbling about for a long time. Set this to extremely high values to disable it.
DamagedLegsDownTimeMin = 20000
DamagedLegsDownTimeMax = 60000
;BleedingSave is the time in milliseconds an NPC is saved from bleeding out after getting downed by leg shots - this is to prevent immersion-breaking deaths (falling down from leg shots and dying almost instantly)
;example: if the value is 10000, this means that if an NPC is forced to the ground by LegsHitThreshold or DamagedLegsDownTime, it will start to bleed out 10 seconds after going down
BleedingSave = 10000


;=====================================================================================
; 5. DYING STATE THRESHOLDS & NPC DEATH
;=====================================================================================
; This is the core of the mod. These settings define the health thresholds for
; entering the dying states, the systems that govern how long NPCs survive in these
; states, and the visual/physical effects that occur.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;DyingStateSystem determines which death mechanic is used when an NPC's health drops below the thresholds.
; 0 = Legacy: The original mod's system, based on a single bleed-out timer and direct health reduction per tick.
; 1 = Progression: A timed system where NPCs are guided through the stages of dying before death.
DyingStateSystem = 1

;DyingStateChance is the chance of DyingStates being used. If a ped crosses DyingMovementThreshold, DyingMovementThreshold2 or DyingThreshold (Dying State 1, 2 and 3), if they fall to the ground they will enter a dying state.
;If that chance doesnt trigger, vanilla game behavior will occur. The value must be between 0 and 100 (0 disables DyingStates completely)
DyingStateChance = 100

;These three parameters control the health threshold in which an NPC will enter one of the three Dying States.
;They can skip a state depending on damage taken, ie a shotgun blast to the stomach might propel their health low enough to trigger Dying State 3.
DS1_Threshold = 50
DS2_Threshold = 30
DS3_Threshold = 20

;MapBlipForNPCsInDS can be set to either 0 or 1, if set to 1, NPCs in DyingStates get a radar blip (so you can find them and finish them off).
MapBlipForNPCsInDS = 0

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 5.1. Dying State System: Progression (used if DyingStateSystem = 1)
; Each dying state has its own configurable duration in milliseconds (1000 = 1s) in
; case you want to have certain states be shorter or longer.
; A random time between Min and Max is chosen when the state begins.
; Note that shooting a ped and forcing them to move up a state will also reset the
; timer to the correct state.
; Free roam settings have been adjusted for a good, realistic bleed out duration.
; "Mission" values are used during active story missions for faster pacing.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DS1_TimeMin = 10000
DS1_TimeMax = 40000
DS1_MissionTimeMin = 5000
DS1_MissionTimeMax = 15000

DS2_TimeMin = 10000
DS2_TimeMax = 40000
DS2_MissionTimeMin = 5000
DS2_MissionTimeMax = 15000

DS3_TimeMin = 15000
DS3_TimeMax = 40000
DS3_MissionTimeMin = 5000
DS3_MissionTimeMax = 15000

;This multiplier is used ONLY when 'Longer Bleedout' is ON in the menu.
;The value is divided by 10 in the script (e.g., 20 = 2.0x multiplier, 15 = 1.5x multiplier).
DyingStateProgressionTime_LongerMultiplier = 20

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 5.2. Dying State System: Legacy (used if DyingStateSystem = 0)
; These settings control the original bleedout timer system. They have  no effect if
; the Progression system is active.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;MaximumDyingStateTime is the maximum amount of milliseconds NPCs will be able to stay alive in dying states.
;This is the primary timer for the Legacy system.
MaximumDyingStateTime = 40000

;This value is used for the Legacy system ONLY when 'Longer Bleedout' is enabled in the menu. Defaults to double the standard time.
MaximumDyingStateTimeLonger = 80000

;BleedWhenDying can be set to either 1 or 0, if set to 1 an NPC will continuously lose health when under the DyingThreshold.
BleedWhenDying = 1
;BleedingChanceDying is the "percentage" chance of bleeding per script iteration when NPC is under the DyingThreshold. It's a raw value, so 12 = 12%.
;The first one is for dying state 1, the second one for dying state 2 and 3.
BleedingChanceDying1 = 20
BleedingChanceDying2 = 10

;LongerBleedingChance and LongerBleedingValue apply when "Longer Bleedouts" are enabled - they overwrite BleedingChanceDying2 and BleedingValue.
LongerBleedingChance = 5
LongerBleedingValue = 5

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 5.3. General Dying State Effects
; These settings control various physical effects that occur when an NPC is in a dying
; state, such as spasms, twitches, and damage reactions.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;A damage multiplier applied to NPCs ONLY when they are already in a dying state.
;Set to 10 for default 1.0x damage. Set to 20 for 2.0x damage, 50 for 5.0x, etc.
;Setting this below 10 (1.0x) does nothing.
DyingStateDamageMultiplier = 20
;If enabled, the DyingStateDamageMultiplier will only apply to torso shots.
DyingStateMultiplierOnlyTorso = 1

;DyingStateMajorSpasms can be set to 1 or 0. Enables spasms during Dying State 3.
DyingStateMajorSpasms = 1
;Chance of occuring (0-100)
DyingStateMajorSpasmsChance = 48
;DyingStateMinorTwitches can be set to 1 or 0. Enables limb twitches during Dying State 3.
;The twitching tapers off over time as the NPC approaches death.
DyingStateMinorTwitches = 1
;Chance of occuring (0-100)
DyingStateMinorTwitchesChance = 38

;Enables or disables the mouth blood spurt effect for NPCs during Dying State 3.
;This is set to 'pulse' in bursts, like spitting up blood.
MouthBloodEffect_Enabled = 1
;Sets the percentage chance (0-100) that an NPC will have the mouth blood spurt effect when they enter Dying State 3.
;You'll want to lower this if you set SyncMouthBloodToTwitches to 0.
MouthBloodEffect_Chance = 60
;SyncMouthBloodToTwitches makes it so that the mouth spurt effect can only trigger during a body twitching sequence, synced with each bucking movement, which looks much more realistic.
;MouthBloodEffect_Chance then becomes the chance of this effect occuring during a twitch.
;Setting this to 0 will make it so that the effect can happen regardless of whether the ped twitches or not, and won't sync to the movement.
SyncMouthBloodToTwitches = 1

;RagdollShotFlinchDuration is the time in milliseconds that a dying state ped will flinch/flail when shot.
;This is a specially scripted physics sequence to workaround the fact that the writhing animations and ragdolls in DS1-DS2-DS3 "lock" the NPC in place in order to keep them on the ground.
;Be very careful if you adjust this setting, as you can break dying states.
RagdollShotFlinchDuration = 150
;RagdollShotForce is the amount of upward physical force applied to a downed ped when shot to simulate impact. This is a raw value in force.
;Be very careful if you adjust this setting, as you can break dying states.
RagdollShotForce = 125


;=====================================================================================
; 6. DYING STATE PUSHDOWN MECHANICS
;=====================================================================================
; This section determines how a standing NPC is forced to the ground when their health
; drops into a dying state threshold.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;DyingStatePushdown determines the method used to force an NPC to the ground when they enter a dying state but are still standing. They are mutually exclusive.
;0 = Push: Immediately forces the NPC to ragdoll with a configurable physical force. More direct, reliable and cinematic.
;1 = Stumble: Does not immediately force an NPC down. Waits for the NPC to run, then trips them with a forceful stumble.
;2 = Hybrid: Randomly chooses between Push or Stumble for each NPC, based on the chance set in Hybrid Method Settings.
DyingStatePushdown = 2

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 6.1. Push Method Settings
; (used if DyingStatePushdown = 0, also used if the Hybrid system is enabled)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;PushTime dictates the duration in milliseconds the physical push force is applied.
;3 seconds is long enough to ensure they're well and truly down.
PushTimeMin = 2
PushTimeMax = 3000
;Defines the overall strength of the dynamic pushdown force. This value is divided by 10 in the script.
;A value of 18 equals a force of 1.8. Higher values mean a stronger push.
;This system doesn't require a high force value given it takes several factors into account which can multiply this value.
DynamicPushForce = 15
;The factor by which the pushdown force is divided when Dead Eye is active. Prevents exaggerated force.
;A value of 2 halves the force, 3 divides it by three, etc. 1 = no change.
DeadEyePushdownForceDivision = 3

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 6.2. Stumble Method Settings
; (used if DyingStatePushdown = 1, also used if the Hybrid system is enabled)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;StumbleChance is the percentage chance (0-100) PER 200MS TICK that a running NPC in a dying state will be tripped.
StumbleChance = 100
;StumbleSpeed is the minimum running speed the NPC must have to be tripped.
;Value is divided by 10 in the script for fine tune control, so 30 = 3 m/s, which is a light jog.
StumbleSpeed = 30
;StumbleForceMagnitude defines the strength of the stumble. This value is divided by 10 in the script.
;A value of 18 equals a force of 1.8. Higher values mean a stronger stumble.
;This system doesn't require a high force value given it takes multiple NPC factors into account, which can multiply this value.
StumbleForceMagnitude = 25

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 6.3. Hybrid Method Settings
; (used if DyingStatePushdown = 2)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;HybridPushdown_PushChance is the percentage chance (0-100) that the 'Push' method will be used for an NPC.
;The remaining percentage is the chance the 'Stumble' method will be used.
HybridPushdown_PushChance = 50

;UseAnimChance is the chance of writhing animations being used instead of NPCs just lying there in pain (the percentage reflects the percentage in NPCs - so 50 will make every second NPC use animations)
;When downing someone who is in cover or on horseback, the animations may still play (whether you activated them or not)
UseAnimChance = 100
;TransitioningDelta represents the time delta between an NPC going down in dying state 1 and transitioning to the wounded animation (UseAnimChance must be set to see results)
TransitioningDelta = 500
;DyingStateHogtie can be set to either 1 or 0. If enabled (= set to 1), NPCs in dying stages who are playing a writhing animation will be automatically bound on wrists and ankles as soon as you lasso them.
;Explanation: normally NPCs in writhing animations can't be lasso-ed without instantly dying - this method circumvents that.
;Lassoing NPC's in dying states is quite buggy, and by design it only works in Dying State 1 & 2 (when it works).
DyingStateHogtie = 1
;DyingStatesForMelee enables or disables the dying states for NPCs who have only been damaged by fists (can be set to either 0 or 1) -> if enabled, knocked out NPCs wont get up again if under any dying threshold
DyingStatesForMelee = 0
;MeleeDyingStateKnockout makes NPCs ragdoll into the DyingStates when in melee combat and their health crosses the DyingMovementThreshold (DyingStatesForMelee has to be enabled for this feature to work) - can be set to either 0 or 1
MeleeDyingStateKnockout = 0

;BodyDamageInterval can be configured in milliseconds
;Since NPCs can also damage their body parts when falling, the mod remembers the last time an NPC was shot by the player - if an NPC was shot by the player and a body part is being damaged within BodyDamageInterval,
;the NPCs body part counts as being shot (thus e.g. enabling the NPC to bleed - for OnlyBleedOnTorsoShot, for example), if the body part is damaged after the BodyDamageInterval has passed, the body part won't be marked as "damaged".
;Best left at this setting.
BodyDamageInterval = 800


;=====================================================================================
; 7. SCRIPT FIXES
;=====================================================================================
; These settings control custom fixes for issues introduced by the script itself.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 7.1. Arterial Bleeding Fix
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;ArterialBleedingFix enables a solution for peds with arterial bleeding getting 'stuck' while fleeing, an infamous PDO bug.
;The script now has proper logic to detect when an NPC has an arterial bleeding wound, with code to ensure they can't get stuck.
ArterialBleedingFix = 1
;ArterialBleedGracePeriod is the time in milliseconds an NPC is given to get up and start fleeing after an arterial wound before ArterialBleedingFix will begin checking if they might get 'stuck'.
;Six seconds is enough time to get up off the ground and begin the fleeing task before the script starts tracking their speed.
;May need to be adjusted depending on your Euphoria mod. Some have longer or shorter down-times than others.
ArterialBleedGracePeriod = 8000
;Lets you control how long a ped with an arterial wound can flee bleeding before they're forced to the ground.
;I keep it between 8 and 60 seconds for variety. Some peds will make it quite a ways off, others won't.
ArterialBleedingFixTimeMin = 8000
ArterialBleedingFixTimeMax = 60000
;If a ped gets an arterial wound but their health drops below a DS threshold, they'll usually fall into a dying state.
;However, this setting allows you to override that behavior, ignoring their health values.
;This enables them to stand and stagger/flee while bleeding regardless of low health.
;Note this does NOT apply to headshot arterial wounds.
;30% chance to occur by default. Set it to 100% and body-shot arterial bleeders will always get back up.
ArterialBleedIgnoreDSChance = 15
;When an NPC with an arterial bleed wound finally collapses, this determines their fate.
;ArterialOutcome_InstantDeathChance is the percentage chance (0-100) the NPC dies on the spot (vanilla behavior).
;The remaining percentage is the chance they will enter Dying State 3 (near death).
ArterialOutcome_InstantDeathChance = 30


;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; 7.2. Dismemberment Fix
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;This system overrides the game's default dismemberment to make it more consistent with PDO's low base damage.
;Note that the explosive ammo fix isn't covered here, it's handled via default_damage_modifiers.meta. If you open that file, you can
;modify "PDOR MODIFIER TO BOOST EXPLOSIVE AMMO DAMAGE" to increase or decrease the damage, depending on your settings.
EnableDismembermentSystem = 1
;The chance that a successful dismemberment will trigger a cinematic kill cam.
DismembermentKillCamChance = 25

;If enabled, this spawns custom blood FX from the head stump of decapitated peds.
;Will eventually spawn blood on stumps too.
DismembermentBloodFX = 1

;These settings define the chance of dismemberment for shotguns and rolling block rifles based on range.
;The script will interpolate the chance between these points.
;For example, for shotguns, a shot at 7 meters will have a chance somewhere between Chance1 and Chance2.
;A shot beyond the final distance (Dist4) will have have an automatically interpolated falloff value to 0%, using Dist3 and Dist4 as a reference.

;The amount of extra shotgun damage. Should be high enough to guarantee a dismemberment.
ShotgunGibDamage = 200
;Point 1: The closest range bracket, in meters, followed by the chance at that range.
ShotgunGibDist1 = 5
ShotgunGibChance1 = 80
;Point 2: The second range bracket, in meters, followed by the chance at that range.
ShotgunGibDist2 = 10
ShotgunGibChance2 = 50
;Point 3: The third range bracket, in meters, followed by the chance at that range.
ShotgunGibDist3 = 15
ShotgunGibChance3 = 20
;Point 4: The farthest range bracket, in meters, followed by the chance at that range.
ShotgunGibDist4 = 20
ShotgunGibChance4 = 10

;The amount of extra sniper rifle (Rolling Block only) damage. Should be high enough to guarantee a dismemberment.
SniperRifleGibDamage = 200
;Point 1: The closest range bracket, in meters, followed by the chance at that range.
SniperRifleGibDist1 = 5
SniperRifleGibChance1 = 90
;Point 2: The second range bracket, in meters, followed by the chance at that range.
SniperRifleGibDist2 = 100
SniperRifleGibChance2 = 90
;Point 3: The third range bracket, in meters, followed by the chance at that range.
SniperRifleGibDist3 = 500

;=====================================================================================
; 8. INJURY EFFECTS
;=====================================================================================
; This section governs how NPCs are physically impaired by damage while they are still
; alive and fighting (i.e., before entering a dying state). It includes accuracy
; reduction, bleeding rules, knockback, and stumbling effects.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; --- 8.1. NPC Accuracy ---
;Enables or disables the entire NPC accuracy system.
EnableNPCAccuracySystem = 1
;NPCAccuracyThreshold - if NPC health is below this threshold, accuracy decreases

DisableLongerBleedoutInMissions = 1

; --- 8.3. Bleeding Rules ---
;BleedWhenShot can be set to either 1 or 0, if set to 1 an NPC will continuously lose health when shot under the KnockbackThreshold.
BleedWhenShot = 0
;BleedingValue is the value of health an NPC loses when bleeding is applied (= one of the bleeding chances kicks in)
BleedingValue = 5
;BleedingChanceShot is the "percentage" chance of bleeding per script iteration (= every ~millisecond) when NPC is under the KnockbackThreshold
;It's a raw value, so 25 = 25%.
;You'll need to tweak this by setting debug mode on, injuring NPC's below the knockback threshold (70 by default), then watching how fast the health ticks down until you find a setting you like.
BleedingChanceShot = 25

;Otherwise, if the ped falls into the dying state, it allows the full effect to play out.

; 16. PLAYER SURVIVAL
;=====================================================================================
; This section adds optional survival mechanics that can make the game more
; challenging, such as core depletion over time and increased money loss upon death.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;CoreDepletion enables or disables the depletion of cores (can be set to either 0 or 1)

; 17. MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES
;=====================================================================================
; This section contains various quality-of-life toggles and other features that don't
; fit into the main categories, such as excluding story NPCs from the mod's effects.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;ExcludeFriendlyStoryNPCs can be set to either 0 or 1 - if set to 1, the mod will not affect friendly story NPCs (like gang members, rain falls, etc.)
ExcludeFriendlyStoryNPCs = 1
;ExcludeOtherStoryNPCs can be set to either 0 or 1 - if set to 1, the mod will not affect "other" (than friendly) story NPCs (like flaco hernandez, emmet granger, angelo bronte, etc.)
ExcludeOtherStoryNPCs = 1

;AlwaysKillWounded makes the toggle-able option via KillWoundedToggleKey set to be always on - will override whatever is toggled
AlwaysKillWounded = 0

;DisableItemGlow makes pickup objects not glow anymore, if set to 1.
;The native function that controls this seems to be broken as of one of the last patches, so it no longer works.
DisableItemGlow = 0

;SneakNoiseMultiplier is the multiplier for the noises the player makes while sneaking - the value is divided by 100 (so 90 would be a multiplier of 0.9 -> 0 disables the feature)
SneakNoiseMultiplier = 0


;=====================================================================================
; 18. MOD COMPATIBILITY
;=====================================================================================
; This section provides toggles and settings for specific features designed to improve
; compatibility and add integrations with other popular mods.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; --- 18.1. BodyGuardSpawner by Shtivi ---
;ExcludeBodyGuardSpawnerBodyguards can be set to either 0 or 1 - if set to 1, NPC Bodyguards spawned with the BodyGuardSpawner Mod won't be affected by PDO's effects
ExcludeBodyGuardSpawnerBodyguards = 1

; --- 18.2. TieYourLasso by TuffyTown ---
;TYLFeaturesEnabled enables the "noose"-features below (for the mod called "TieYourLasso") if set to 1 and disables them if set to 0
;this also enables NPCs begging and panicking while in a noose and not hanging - NooseAudioChance also works here
TYLFeaturesEnabled = 1

;NooseAudio can be set to either 1 or 0 - if set to 1, NPCs being hanged via TieYourLasso-mod will react audibly
NooseAudio = 1

;NooseAudioChance is the chance (between 0 and 10000) per millisecond that an NPC will audibly react when being hanged via TieYourLasso-mod
NooseAudioChance = 50

;MuteNoosedNPCs can be set to either 1 or 0 - if set to 1, NPCs hanged via TieYourLasso-mod won't make any sounds while hanging
MuteNoosedNPCs = 0

;NoosedNPCsLiveLonger makes NPCs hanged by the TieYourLasso-mod live longer by applying the NooseHealthBoost (below)
NoosedNPCsLiveLonger = 1

;NooseHealthBoost only works if NoosedNPCsLiveLonger is enabled - the set amount will be added to the hanging NPCs health each NooseHealthBoostInterval (if it is set too high, the NPC will never die or die even quicker (game engine problem))
NooseHealthBoost = 4

;NooseHealthBoostInterval is the interval in milliseconds the health boost is added to a hanging NPC's health (1500 would be every 1,5 seconds)
NooseHealthBoostInterval = 1500

;NooseHangingHeight is the height (in whatever unit the game measures - I have no idea) the feet of a hanging NPC have to be above the ground, in order for the NPC to be counted as "hanging" (for audio and health boost)
;this value is divided by 100 before being used for measurement
NooseHangingHeight = 20

;NooseFaceTurn can be set to either 0 or 1 - if set to 1, noosed NPCs will try to look at you while standing or talking (with their head in the noose, not hanged yet)
NooseFaceTurn = 1


;=====================================================================================
; 19. ADVANCED/INTERNAL VALUES (TWEAK AT YOUR OWN RISK)
;=====================================================================================
; These are internal script variables that control the fine-tuning of the mod's
; physics and timing. It is strongly recommended not to change these unless you know
;exactly what you are doing.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;Don't touch or VERY BAD THINGS will happen.
IgnoreUpVector = 1

IsDyingDirectionRelative = 1

;ZValueForHeadBone is used for checking the z-value of the vector returned by | ENTITY::GET_WORLD_POSITION_OF_ENTITY_BONE(peds[i], 21030) | -> peds[i] is the current NPC and 21030 is the bone ID of its head. If the z-value of the head is below this value, the dyingpush does not trigger. Setting this too low will break dying states.
ZValueForHeadBone = 600

;ZValueForHeadBone is used for checking the z-value of the vector returned by | ENTITY::GET_WORLD_POSITION_OF_ENTITY_BONE(peds[i], 21030) | -> peds[i] is the current NPC and 21030 is the bone ID of its head. If the z-value of the head is above this value, the dyingpush does not trigger.
ZValueForHeadBone2 = 3000

;ZValueForHipBone is used for checking the z-value of the vector returned by | ENTITY::GET_WORLD_POSITION_OF_ENTITY_BONE(peds[i], 14415) | -> peds[i] is the current NPC and 14415 is the bone ID of its lower spine. If the z-value of the hip is above this value, the dying movement does not trigger.
ZValueForHipBone = 600

;RagdollingSpeedThreshold is the speed an NPC is allowed to have for the ragdolling to set in (DyingStates) - if the NPC is moving with a speed above the threshold, ragdolling will not happen (since it can look weird)
RagdollingSpeedThreshold = 7
DSRagdollingSpeedThreshold = 15

;HeadVecMaxDeltaB - same as above, but for NPCs who are bleeding out (will stop running after some time and just stand around).
;THIS VALUE IS NOW DEPRECATED AND REPLACED WITH THE DEDICATED ARTERIAL BLEEDING FIX
HeadVecMaxDeltaB = 20
HeadVecMaxTimeB = 2500

;DyingMovementEnableWhenSpeedLowerThan - if DyingMovement is enabled, the NPC has to be slower than the given speed value to get the DyingMovement applied
DyingMovementEnableWhenSpeedLowerThan = 10

;FemalePushModifier is the value the normal push value is divided by when pushing is applied to female NPCs (because they are lighter than male NPCs)
FemalePushModifier = 3

;HandsUpTime is the time in milliseconds for NPCs to at least put their hands up if a mod-feature (like disarming) forces them to
HandsUpTime = 400000

;HandsUpDelta is the time in milliseconds the mod waits after an NPC is disarmed and the DisarmHandsUpChance is triggered, before it tasks the NPC with the "hands up" behavior
HandsUpDelta = 500
HandsUpDeltaMounted = 500

;HandsUpRadius is the radius around the player in which NPCs put their hands up when being disarm and DisarmHandsUpChance is triggered (the value is divided by 100 before it is used for measurement)
HandsUpRadius = 2000


;=====================================================================================
; 20. ANIMAL DAMAGE SETTINGS
;=====================================================================================
; This section allows you to configure how damage is applied to animals, either using
; a simple, flat multiplier or the same detailed per-weapon system used for human NPCs.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;When set to 1, animals will be excluded from the detailed per-weapon damage multipliers below. Instead, they will use a single, flat damage multiplier for all weapons.
;When set to 0, animals will use the same detailed per-weapon damage multipliers as human NPCs.
ExcludeAnimalsFromDamageModifiers = 1
;This is the flat damage multiplier applied to ALL defined player weapons against animals.
;This setting ONLY works if ExcludeAnimalsFromDamageModifiers is set to 1.
;Value is a percentage multiplier. 10 = 1.0x (vanilla), 20 = 2.0x (double damage), 5 = 0.5x (half damage).
AnimalDamageMultiplier = 10


;=====================================================================================
; 21. INDIVIDUAL WEAPON DAMAGE
;=====================================================================================
; This section replaces the old SpecialWeaponModifier and WeaponModifier.
; You can now set a damage modifier for each weapon individually.
; The value is a percentage (e.g., 30 = 30% of base damage, 150 = 150% of base damage).
; The mod's balance is predicated on 30% damage reduction across the board for firearms
; at default health values, so be careful adjusting these values.
