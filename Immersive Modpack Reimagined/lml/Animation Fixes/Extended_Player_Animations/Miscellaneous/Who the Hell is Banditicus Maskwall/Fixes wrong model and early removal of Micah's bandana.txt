During the "Who the Hell is Leviticus Cornwall?" mission, once the train starts coming, you'll spot Micah using the wrong bandana model in a couple of shots during the cutscene (you can tell by the way the mask clips through Micah's headwear), and soon after realizing the dynamite failed, you'll also spot Micah not only with his bandana taken off too early, but his beard removed too. This little file fixes all of those inconsistencies.
