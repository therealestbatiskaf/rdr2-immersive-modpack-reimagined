# RDR 2 | Immersive Modpack Reimagined

**P.S. I DID NOT MAKE THOSE MODS, I JUST COLLECTED THEM AND CHANGED A FEW CODE LINES TO MATCH MY PREFERENCES AND MADE THEM WORK TOGETHER
THANKS ALL OF YOU WHO MADE THEM, I JUST PHYSICALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO MENTION ALL OF YOU, PROPS TO Y'ALL**

[_the most interesting part_](#installation)

[you can support it here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3360218197)

The first version is no longer supported. This one will be supported as long as it has interest of players.

It focuses on using all RDR 2 mechanics, making it more immersive and real, not Real Life real, but make it more immersive,
make the game, like all of us - fans, would like to see it.

It's highly recommended to play game with **HDR**, also, to make your game look like mine - use my settings, I included them in the [**OPTIONALS**](#optionals)
folder. Read [**README**](#readme) section.

You can read about controls on certain mods here [**CONTROLS**](#controls).

## CONTROLS

- [**SMOKING**](#smoking-complete)
- [**NEEDS**](#basic-needs)
- [**DRAG NPCs**](#drag-npcs)

### Smoking Complete
Features:
Key for cigarette is N, for cigar it's I. (customizable)

1. Quick Smoke: Tap key to just quick smoke.
2. Longer Smoking: Hold key to long smoke. (If you hold for 2 seconds you will leave the cigarette in mouth instead)
3. Move to mouth: Hold key while smoking to move the cigarette/cigar to your mouth and free your hands. This way you can do chores, carry bodies, shoot, hunt, grill meat and more.
4. Take cigarette/cigar in hand: Hold key while cigarette/cigar is in your mouth to take it back in your hand.
5. Throw away: Press key while smoking to throw away your cigarette/cigar.
6. Open scenarios menu: Hold Y to open a menu with scenarios like sitting on the ground, leaning on things etc. (You can add scenarios in the settings)

Controller support:
Support is slightly limited. You will not be able to start smoking during poker and other mini games. Keep the cigarette in your mouth before you sit down.

To start smoking(simple explanation): 
- Press the **DPad right (without holding it)** and use **RB (R1)**. Then select Cigarette or Cigar. 
- To control the cigarette, press the **DPad right (without holding it)**. You will see a prompt that says "Throw/Move Cigarette", 
then hold **RB (R1)** to move cigarette or **tap RB (R1)** to throw it away.
- To open the scenarios menu just press **DPad right (without holding it)** and then open the Scenarios menu using **DPad up**.

**Gameplay details:**
While smoking you will regenerate Dead Eye over time. This is useful if you don't want to spam items in a gunfight. You will gain a bit more Dead Eye if you hold the cigarette in your hand(out of combat).
Drawing your gun will automatically put the cigarette in your mouth before you draw your gun. This is configurable
If you have your gun drawn out, and you try to start smoking, you will use your free hand to quickly light up a cigarette and leave it in your mouth.

### Basic Needs

The needs is basic in use, just take care of the cores that appeared:
- Hunger
- Thirst
- Urination
- Exhaustion
- Temperature - while in cold biome or warm one, the temperature will impact your cores, depending on what clothes
you got on.
- Weight - debuffs you while having a lot of weapons on you, every weapons has different impact on weight. So now
you won't be able freely using 2 longarms. Gotta prepare.
- Penalties

There are two types of penalties that the player receives when one of the new cores reaches zero. Your normal cores 
drain at an accelerated rate or/and you will receive a "poison" effect. 

Translations for the mod can be downloaded on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/reddeadredemption2/search?keyword=basic+needs).

### Drag NPCs

- You must be near a ped to trigger the mod.
- To trigger the mod, **double tap G** on keyboard, or **double tap Right Stick** on controller. This will shove the ped to the ground
into the intimidated state
- Once a ped is shoved onto the ground, simply press one of the prompts that appear to do its action

## README

You can turn off certain mods via Mod Manager, I included it in the repo.

Things you can turn off without breaking the game.

Blood FX, HUD reticle:
- If you want vanilla blood turn off Improvements In Blood + Whyem's Bloodlust.
- If you want vanilla blood but with intense blood pools + splatters - turn off Improvements In Blood only.
- If you want vanilla pools and splatters but with new textures (more realistic) turn off Whyem's Bloodlust.
- If you want vanilla reticle - **delete** hud_reticle.gfx file from lml/stream/

### OPTIONALS
Choose only **ONE** setting from **certain folder numbers 00, 01, 02**. You can find them in **OPTIONALS** folder.

To install Navy Revolver:
- Drag and drop files inside "navy revolver" in the game folder.

To install my settings from 04 go to:
- User - Documents - Rockstar Games - Red Dead Redemption 2 - Settings and **Drag and Drop my settings into the folder**

I made a lot of **"complex"** settings for Hit Markers and Head Bleeding, so you could choose one suited for you.
Also, **to complete achievements or gold medals** - you should **turn off** head bleeding, cause it totally remakes headshot
system and can cause **issues** with counting headshots.

Rampage Trainer **ONLY and HIGHLY** recommended for **DEBUG** purposes, don't use it to pass through the game.
